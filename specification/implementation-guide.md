# Implementation Guide

4-week plan to implement the Data Steward framework in your SaaS product.

---

## Week 1: Data Integrity Foundation

**Goal**: Document your current data model and implement basic validation

### Day 1-2: Data Discovery
- [ ] List all database tables in your product
- [ ] Identify required vs. optional fields
- [ ] Document foreign key relationships
- [ ] Create initial data dictionary using [template](../templates/data-dictionary-template.md)

**Deliverable**: Completed data dictionary for core tables

### Day 3-4: Quality Validation Setup
- [ ] Write SQL queries to check for NULL values in required fields
- [ ] Write queries to detect orphaned records
- [ ] Write queries to validate data formats (emails, dates, etc.)
- [ ] Save queries to `scripts/validation-queries.sql`

**Deliverable**: Validation query suite

### Day 5: Automation
- [ ] Add validation queries to your CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Set up alerts for validation failures
- [ ] Document how to run validations locally

**Deliverable**: Automated data quality checks

---

## Week 2: Privacy & Security

**Goal**: Identify and protect personal data, implement deletion

### Day 1-2: PII Inventory
- [ ] Review every table and identify PII fields
- [ ] Document legal basis for each PII field (contract, consent, legitimate interest)
- [ ] Define retention period for each data type
- [ ] Complete [PII inventory template](../templates/pii-inventory.yml)

**Deliverable**: Complete PII inventory

### Day 3-4: Deletion Implementation
- [ ] Write SQL script to delete a user and all related data
- [ ] Write SQL script to anonymize data that must be retained (audit logs)
- [ ] Test deletion on staging environment
- [ ] Complete [deletion test checklist](../templates/deletion-test-checklist.md)

**Deliverable**: Tested deletion procedure

### Day 5: Security Validation
- [ ] Verify database connection uses TLS/SSL
- [ ] Verify database encryption at rest is enabled
- [ ] Document who has access to production data
- [ ] Verify non-production environments don't contain real PII

**Deliverable**: Security verification report

## Week 3: Change Management

**Goal**: Establish schema version control and safe migration practices

### Day 1-2: Migration Framework Setup
- [ ] Choose migration tool (e.g., Flyway, Liquibase, or database-native)
- [ ] Create migrations directory structure
- [ ] Document current schema as baseline migration
- [ ] Set up migration tracking table

**Deliverable**: Migration framework in place

### Day 3-4: Process Documentation
- [ ] Adopt [schema change template](../templates/schema-change-template.md)
- [ ] Document approval process for schema changes
- [ ] Create example migration with rollback script
- [ ] Test rollback procedure

**Deliverable**: Change management process documented

### Day 5: Integration
- [ ] Add schema change review to pull request template
- [ ] Configure CI to validate migrations
- [ ] Train team on new process

**Deliverable**: Change management integrated into workflow

---

## Week 4: Documentation & Validation

**Goal**: Complete documentation and validate all gates

### Day 1-2: Documentation Completion
- [ ] Review and update data dictionary
- [ ] Review and update PII inventory
- [ ] Document all validation queries and their expected results
- [ ] Create README for your data governance documentation

**Deliverable**: Complete documentation package

### Day 3-4: End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Run all validation queries and verify they pass
- [ ] Test deletion procedure with test user
- [ ] Deploy a schema change using new process
- [ ] Verify rollback capability

**Deliverable**: All gates validated

### Day 5: Team Training
- [ ] Present framework to team
- [ ] Walk through each gate and its validation
- [ ] Answer questions and gather feedback
- [ ] Schedule first quarterly review

**Deliverable**: Team trained and framework operational

---

## Post-Implementation

### Monthly Tasks
- [ ] Run validation queries and review results
- [ ] Update PII inventory if new fields added
- [ ] Review schema changes from past month

### Quarterly Tasks
- [ ] Full validation of all three gates
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Test deletion procedure
- [ ] Review and improve processes

### When to Expand

Add optional features when needed:

**Performance Monitoring** (Quarter 2-3)
- When queries regularly exceed 1 second
- When database has >100k records
- When users report slowness

**Advanced Compliance** (Quarter 3-4)
- When expanding to EU (GDPR required)
- When preparing for Series A
- When handling payment data (PCI-DSS)

**Audit Logging** (Quarter 4+)
- When compliance audit scheduled
- When security incident investigation needed
- When detailed access tracking required

## Common Implementation Challenges

**Challenge**: "We don't know all our PII fields"
**Solution**: Start with obvious ones (email, name, phone). Add more as discovered. This is iterative.

**Challenge**: "Deletion breaks things due to foreign keys"
**Solution**: Use CASCADE on foreign keys where appropriate. For data you must retain, anonymize instead of delete.

**Challenge**: "Team resistant to schema change process"
**Solution**: Start lightweight. Require only template and approval, not full testing initially. Add rigor over time.

**Challenge**: "CI/CD doesn't support running database queries"
**Solution**: Start with manual weekly validation. Automate when you can. Manual is better than nothing.

**Challenge**: "We have tech debt and can't meet all standards now"
**Solution**: Document current state, create remediation plan, implement for new code first. Fix old code iteratively.

## Success Metrics

After 4 weeks, you should have:
- ✅ Zero NULL values in required fields
- ✅ Zero orphaned records
- ✅ Complete PII inventory
- ✅ Tested user deletion procedure
- ✅ Schema change process with 100% adoption
- ✅ All validation queries automated

**Next Level** (Months 2-6):
- Expand to optional enterprise features as needed
- Reduce validation failures to zero consistently
- Train new team members on framework
- Contribute improvements back to framework
